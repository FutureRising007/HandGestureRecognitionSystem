# HandGestureRecognitionSystem
# Project Owner: Mohammad Kaif Ahmed

@ This project is made in OpenCV, Tensorflow. It is basically inclined to be a Video Player, you can alter it according to your wish by altering the dataset

@ Here, you need to follow the following steps to run the program: 
  1. First create a virtual environment using Anaconda Prompt<br>
    (If you're not having a Anaconda version installed, please do get one)
    
  2. Then install all the required libraries into that Virtual Environment by using the requirements.txt
  
  3. Then open the Classification.py file, and change the trained model path to your path.<br>
    (You can get the trained model and the testing video here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10xK7Ys33wYQ7wH-MRZqNMjutWQ0q5Sg-?usp=sharing)
    
   4. Then you can activate your Virtual Environment and thus can run the 'Classification.py' script.
   
   ENJOY AND HAVE FUN !! :)
